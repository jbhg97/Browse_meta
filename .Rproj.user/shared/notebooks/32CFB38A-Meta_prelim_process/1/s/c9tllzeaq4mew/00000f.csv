"0","#DN: I'll note some odd missing data patterns where you're missing trt and control means and N. I think if you're missing means I'd probably just exclude. I would probably limit imputation to situations where you: 1) have N and 2) have means, but are missing SDs OR 1) have SD, SE and 2) have means. I think the missing data patterns in there that you have at times are not really conducive to imputation. "
